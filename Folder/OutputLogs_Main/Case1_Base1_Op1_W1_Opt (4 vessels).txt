	The route visits installation(s) 2 at day 5, 8 at day 6, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 7 (before 8am).
On day 7, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 2, the vessel starts sailing route 136 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 2 at day 2, 8 at day 3, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 4 (before 8am).
On day 4, the vessel starts sailing route 516 from base 1 at 4pm.

	The route visits installation(s) 7 at day 7, 8 at day 8, 10 at day 8, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 9 (before 8am).
On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF VESSEL 3 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 2, the vessel starts sailing route 96 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 1 at day 2, 12 at day 3, 4 at day 3, 10 at day 4, 12 at day 4, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 5 (before 8am).
On day 5, the vessel starts sailing route 688 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 5 at day 5, 7 at day 5, 2 at day 6, 11 at day 6, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 7 (before 8am).
On day 7, the vessel starts sailing route 831 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 6 at day 8, 12 at day 7, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 9 (before 8am).
On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF VESSEL 4 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 2, the vessel starts sailing route 148 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 5 at day 2, 6 at day 2, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 4 (before 8am).
On day 4, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 5, the vessel starts sailing route 734 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 12 at day 5, 1 at day 6, 6 at day 6, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 8 (before 8am).
On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 10 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 4 vessel(s), there are 4 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 10 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 75.6 tons of CO2.


The 10 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 285.1 tons of CO2.



Mongstad is defined as base number 1. A total of 10 routes sailed by FLEET vessels and 0 SPOT sailings starts at Mongstad.
It is assumed that a share of 25% of the cargo needs to be transported with truck from Stavanger.
This results in extra CO2 emissions from truck transportation equal to 16.2251 tons.

Hence, the TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE: 376.925 tons of CO2.
