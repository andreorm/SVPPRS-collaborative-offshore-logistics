On day 7, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF VESSEL 3 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel starts sailing route 17 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 1 at day 2, 2 at day 1, 12 at day 2,

	The route visits installation(s) 11 at day 6, 6 at day 6, 7 at day 7, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 8 (before 8am).
On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF VESSEL 4 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 2, the vessel starts sailing route 152 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 6 at day 2, 6 at day 3, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 4 (before 8am).

------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 12 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 4 vessel(s), there are 4 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 12 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 64.8 tons of CO2.


The 12 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 305.7 tons of CO2.
