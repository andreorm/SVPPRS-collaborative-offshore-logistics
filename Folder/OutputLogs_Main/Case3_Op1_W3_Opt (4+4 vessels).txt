------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 29 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 5 gets available at day 1 at base 2,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 2 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 6 gets available at day 1 at base 2,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 2 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 7 gets available at day 1 at base 2,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 2 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 8 gets available at day 1 at base 2,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 2 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 8 vessel(s), there are 8 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 29 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 86.4 tons of CO2.


The 29 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 878.3 tons of CO2.

A total of 2 voyages are sailed starting and ending in different bases,
where 2 of these are carrying cargo.
These routes contributes to a total of 6.57835 tons of CO2 from inter-base truck transportation.


Mongstad is defined as base number 1. A total of 19 routes sailed by FLEET vessels and 0 SPOT sailings starts at Mongstad.
It is assumed that a share of 25% of the cargo needs to be transported with truck from Stavanger.
This results in extra CO2 emissions from truck transportation equal to 27.2626 tons.

Hence, the TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE: 998.541 tons of CO2.
