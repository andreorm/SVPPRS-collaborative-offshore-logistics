------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 28 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 5 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 6 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 7 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 8 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 9 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 10 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 11 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 11 vessel(s), there are 11 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 28 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 167.4 tons of CO2.


The 28 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 1221.8 tons of CO2.


Hence, the TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE: 1389.2 tons of CO2.
