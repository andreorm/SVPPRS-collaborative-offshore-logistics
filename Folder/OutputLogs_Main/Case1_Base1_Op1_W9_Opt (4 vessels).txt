------- THE USE OF VESSEL 1 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel starts sailing route 13 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 2 at day 1, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 3 (before 8am).
On day 3, the vessel starts sailing route 243 from base 1 at 4pm.

------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 14 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 4 vessel(s), there are 4 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 14 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 54 tons of CO2.


The 14 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 341.8 tons of CO2.



Mongstad is defined as base number 1. A total of 14 routes sailed by FLEET vessels and 0 SPOT sailings starts at Mongstad.
It is assumed that a share of 25% of the cargo needs to be transported with truck from Stavanger.
This results in extra CO2 emissions from truck transportation equal to 21.7218 tons.

Hence, the TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE: 417.522 tons of CO2.
