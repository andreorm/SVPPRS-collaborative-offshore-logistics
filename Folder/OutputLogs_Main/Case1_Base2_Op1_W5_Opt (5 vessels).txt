The current logistics system consists of 12 offshore installations which must be served. 
Cargo demands are only requested on certain days within the planning period of 8 days. 
There is a total of 5 vessels in the fleet, and a set of 312 voyages have been pregenerated.

------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 11 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 5 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 5 vessel(s), there are 5 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 11 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 97.2 tons of CO2.


The 11 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 439.4 tons of CO2.


Hence, the TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE: 536.6 tons of CO2.
