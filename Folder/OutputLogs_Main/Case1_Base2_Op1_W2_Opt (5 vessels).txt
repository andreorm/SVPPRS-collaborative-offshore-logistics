The current logistics system consists of 12 offshore installations which must be served. 
Cargo demands are only requested on certain days within the planning period of 8 days. 
There is a total of 5 vessels in the fleet, and a set of 432 voyages have been pregenerated.

	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 4 (before 8am).
On day 4, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 5, the vessel starts sailing route 294 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 17 at day 6, 19 at day 6, 20 at day 6, 21 at day 6, 22 at day 6, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 8 (before 8am).
On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF VESSEL 4 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel starts sailing route 26 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 16 at day 2, 15 at day 3, 23 at day 2, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 4 (before 8am).
On day 4, the vessel starts sailing route 137 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 13 at day 5, 20 at day 5, 21 at day 5, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 6 (before 8am).
On day 6, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 7, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF VESSEL 5 ------- 
On day 1, the vessel starts sailing route 8 from base 1 at 4pm.
	The route visits installation(s) 13 at day 2, 20 at day 2, 
	before returning to base 1 at the start of day 3 (before 8am).
On day 3, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 5, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 6, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 7, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 8, the vessel waits at base 1.

On day 9, the vessel waits at base 1.


------- THE USE OF SPOT VESSELS ------- 


------- THE UTILIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY ------- 
A total of 8 voyages are sailed.
The solution produced selects routes that in total makes 0 shifts of delivery date
In other words, there are no use of flexibility in the obtained solution (might not be allowed)



------- THE FLEET BALANCE BETWEEN BASES ------- 
Vessel 1 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 2 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 3 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 4 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.
Vessel 5 gets available at day 1 at base 1,
and ends its (local) planning horizon at day 10 in base 1 after waiting since day 9.

Furthermore, there is a need for 0 spot vessel(s) in total.

From a fleet of 5 vessel(s), there are 5 vessel(s) in use in the optimal solution
A total of 8 voyages are sailed.
Waiting in port (20% of idling emissions) yields in total 124.2 tons of CO2.


The 8 FLEET vessel voyages contribute with 357.1 tons of CO2.


Hence, the TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE: 481.3 tons of CO2.
